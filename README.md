# covid-19_and_pneumonia_identification
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">The dataset contains <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-15hd59n-Anchor e14vpv2g0">X-ray lung scans</a> with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, I will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patientâ€™s X-ray scan. I hope this model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between the research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible. </p>
