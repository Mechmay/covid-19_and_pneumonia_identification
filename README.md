# covid-19_and_pneumonia_identification
&lt;p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">You are a researcher in a hospital lab and are given the task to develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. At your disposal, you have a set &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-15hd59n-Anchor e14vpv2g0">X-ray lung scans&lt;/a> with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, you will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. You hope this model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between your research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.&lt;/p>
